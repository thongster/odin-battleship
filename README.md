Project: Battleship from The Odin Project's Javascript course

I ended up theming it into a Diablo 2 Loot Finder, which honestly made the whole thing way more fun to work on.

This project was pretty hard. The biggest challenge for me was handling state properly. Just like the last game project (Tic-Tac-Toe), things get messy really fast if you don’t plan ahead. Testing also made things tougher because it forces you to actually think through your program architecture before you even write half the functions you think you need. TDD exposed a lot of my bad habits but I’m glad I pushed through it.

For this project I used:
- Webpack
- ES6 Modules
- Jest (TDD)
- Eslint + Prettier
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript

Pretty much everything we’ve learned so far in The Odin Project all coming together in one big assignment. It definitely showed me where my weaknesses are (state management, planning, organizing modules), but also showed me how far I’ve come from when I started.

Overall, a fun and frustrating project in the best way.
